Sorry this is going to be a placeholder for now, I swear I can not get JavaFX to work correctly at all, it keeps throwing every error under the sun and just wont recognize the lib files.
For some reason even when I have my javafx dependencies in the lib folder it is still throwing errors about how javafx is not resolved or something
tried modifying the launch.json file to include a path the a javafx download but that didnt do anything
tried using intellij instead and same issue
redownloading java and javafx versions did nothing
it must be some random thing that Im just not seeing
Once I get it fixed I'll reupload these. Sorry.
